Object Oriented Programming Features
    Abstraction
    Encapsulation
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism

    1. Inheritance  (Parent and child class)  --Keyword = extend
    2. Encapsulation = Hide the data
    3. Abstraction  = keep the comman values in one class
    4. Polymorphism: you can create multiple implementation of single values..


    Inheritance  (Parent and child class)  --Keyword = extend

     Test.
      1 Demo class (main)

      1. Animal class
         - int age;
         - int runSpeed;
         - String name;

         -- Method
         - move (void)


         --Child class   1. Cat  2. Dog
         reuse the method and variable from super class..

  2. Encapsulation


  3. Abstraction
  - An abstract class has no use until unless it is extended by some other class.
  - If you declare an abstract method in a class then you must declare the
        class abstract as well. you can’t have abstract method in a concrete class.
        It’s vice versa is not always true: If a class is not having any abstract method
        then also it can be marked as abstract.
  - It can have non-abstract method (concrete) as well.

  some basics and example of abstract method.
  1) Abstract method has no body.
  2) Always end the declaration with a semicolon(;).
  3) It must be overridden. An abstract class must be extended and in a
     same way abstract method must be overridden.
  4) A class has to be declared abstract to have abstract methods.
